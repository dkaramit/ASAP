Things to do (no particular order):
-----------------------------------

-VEGAS (almost ready -- needs some minor (?) adjustments.). 1-D almost ready

-Solve systems of differential equations (some classic examples along with ROS3W ready! They need some documentation. I'll also write other Rosenbrock ones.).

-Algorithms for histograming data (in many dimensions). 

-Maximum likelihood, least squares (applications of MCMC).

-Component-wise Sampling for Metropolis [see https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/mcmc-multivariate-distributions-block-wise-component-wise-updates/]

-Gibbs sampler

-Simulated annealing (it should be easy enough).

-Solve optimization problems (stochastically).

-Hamiltonian  Monte  Carlo (no idea how to do this for the moment, but seems good [arXiv:1701.02434])

-Artificial neural networks. ANN with arbitrary number of hidden layers ready. Also, a number of different options
for activation and loss functions available.
