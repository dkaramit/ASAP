Things to do (no particular order):
-----------------------------------


-Examples of Discrete Marcov Chains and try to understand their mechanics (a bit of theory would be nice).#done


-Component-wise Sampling for Metropolis (there is a useful blog: https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/) 
[see https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/mcmc-multivariate-distributions-block-wise-component-wise-updates/]


-Gibbs sampler


-Define 'burn-in period' and 'converge' rules for Metropolis.


-Simulated annealing (it should be easy enough).


-Solve optimization problems (stochasticly).


-VEGAS (almost ready. Needs some corrections.)


-Algorithms for histograming data (in many dimensions). 


-Solve systems of differential equations (almost ready!).


-Hamiltonian  Monte  Carlo (no idea... arXiv:1701.02434)
