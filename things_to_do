Things to do (no particular order):

1)Examples of Discrete Marcov Chains and try to understand their mechanics (a bit of theory would be nice).
2)Solve optimization problems (stochasticly).
3)Define 'burn-in period' and 'converge' rules for Metropolis.
4)Simulated annealing (it should be easy enough).
5)VEGAS
6)Algorithms for histograming data (in many dimensions). 
7)Solve systems of differencial equations (almost ready!).
