Things to do (no particular order):
-----------------------------------


-Examples of Discrete Marcov Chains and try to understand their mechanics (a bit of theory would be nice).#done

-Define 'burn-in period' and 'converge' rules for Metropolis.#done!


-VEGAS (almost ready -- needs some minor (?) adjustments.)


-LU decomposition, only because it is used in Rosenbrock method for differential equations. #It is done, but only useful in solving differential equations (so, it will be part of this batch).


-Solve systems of differential equations (some classic examples along with ROS3W ready! They need some documentation. I'll also write other Rosenbrock ones.).
#########Comment on ROS3W: it is very simple and works even for some coupled stiff equations that I've tried! 


-Algorithms for histograming data (in many dimensions). 


-Maximum likelihood, least squares.


-Gaussian mixture -- EM algorithm.

-Component-wise Sampling for Metropolis [see https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/mcmc-multivariate-distributions-block-wise-component-wise-updates/]


-Gibbs sampler



-Simulated annealing (it should be easy enough).


-Solve optimization problems (stochastically).





-Hamiltonian  Monte  Carlo (no idea how to do this for the moment, but seems good [arXiv:1701.02434])
