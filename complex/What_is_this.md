This is a header only C++ library for complex numbers. It is built as an example on how to define complex numbers, and not compete with the standard complex C++ library. 

The main issue is that there are only a few function implemented, to show that once you have defined the arg, log, and exp, everything else is just only a matter of decomposing the complex number in real and imaginary parts and passing them to these functions.
