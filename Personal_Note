Hi everyone.

I'm trying to create a package in order to understand how various numerical tools (such as VEGAS, odsint etc.) work.
I'll try to write some scripts in python (maybe later I will translate them in something faster like C++ and Fortran)
that perform some of these calculations. 

For the moment I'm working on Monte-Carlo, and I have succesfully implemented the plain MC, the Accept-Reject MC
flavours, Marcov-Chains, and VEGAS (this is not complete, only jupyter notebooks since I'm tesing ghem). Also, I 
have some algorithms (Euler, inverse Euler, SDIRK-2-1-2, and ROS3w) for (systems) differential equations (still 
need documentation and comments in these codes). I am prepairing a code for artificial neural networks, where I 
have a working neural net, with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. However, the code needs "cleaning". So,
it may take some time until I upload it.

Since I am selftought on these subjects, I cannot give you my word that the codes work as intented. So, If you are 
looking for something that works better, look at other available tools online.  However, if you are trying to understand 
what makes these tools work, maybe you will find my scripts helpful. Remember that I am still learning, so I may not be 
able to help if something does not work. Furthermore, since I am a postdoc, I'm busy with my research. So if I don't answer 
any questions, it's nothing personal.

As a final note, I'll try to use packages like scipy as little as possible, but for some simple things (e.g. products, sums etc.) 
I'll use some of the ready to use packages for convinience and for testing my results against relible algorithms. So, in order to 
run these scripts without any issues, you should have at least scipy and matplotlib intalled, and use python 2.7 (that's what I'm 
using). Since the  codes are kept  as simple as possible, everything should work in python3+, with some minor changes (mainly the 
print commands).



Cheers,
Dimitris
