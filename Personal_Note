Hi everyone.

I'm trying to create a package in order to understand how various numerical tools (such as VEGAS, odsint etc.) work.
I'll try to write some scripts in python (maybe later I will translate them in something faster like C++ and Fortran)
that perform some calculations. 

For the moment I'm working on Monte-Carlo, and I have succesfully implemented the plain MC and the Accept-Reject MC
flavours. Since I am selftought on these subjects, I cannot give you my word that the codes work as intented. So,
If you are looking for something that works better, look at other available tools online.  However, if you 
are trying to understand what makes these tools work, maybe you will find my scripts helpful. Remember that I am still
learning, so I may not be able to help if something does not work. 


I'll try to use scipy as little as possible, but for some simple things (e.g. min, max, sum etc.). 
So, in order to run these scripts, you should have at least scipy and matplotlib intalled, and
use python 2.7 (that's what I'm using). 



Cheers,
Dimitris
